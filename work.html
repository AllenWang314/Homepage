					<h2>UROP in course 18</h2> 
				<p> I finished my project with Guangyi Yue and Professor Bezrukavnikov that was originally from the MIT PRIMES program. The project, titled "Relationship Between Mullineux Involution and Generalized Regularization" is about operators from the combinatorics in representation theory. The paper was recently published in the <a href = https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S019566981930160X> European Journal of Combinatorics</a> and can also be accessed on the <a href = https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.07732> arxiv</a>.

					<h2>Learn Ventures</h2> 
				<p> I worked as a software engineer intern at Learn Ventures, where I helped write course content and create adaptive learning models. I wrote lectures and assignments for math background that was needed to learn machine learning. I used natural language processing packages such as Stanford's NLP package, wiki2vec, and word2vec to make a map of topics and their dependencies.

					<h2>Acton-Boxborough Math Competition</h2> 
				<p>
					I co-founded <a href = https://abmathcompetition.org/>ABMC</a> in 2016 and served as its president. We saw the contest grow from a local level to an international level, drawing over 1000 students per year. As we continue to grow, we are always promoting an interest in stem and working to encourage students through exciting events. Currently, I am on the board of trustees for ABMC, which, lossely speaking, means that I'm still involved, but not really involved, if you know what I mean.
