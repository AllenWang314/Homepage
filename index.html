				<p>
		Welcome to my website! I'm Allen Wang, a first-year student at <a href= "http://web.mit.edu/">MIT</a> currently residing in Next House 5E. I grew up in Acton, Massachusetts, where I graduated from <a href = "https://abrhs.abschools.org/"> Acton-Boxborough Regional High School</a> in 2019.

								<h2>Interests
				</h2>
				<p class>
					I'm planning to study Computer Science (course 6-3) and Mathematics (course 18). Broadly speaking, my interests are tech and entrepreneurship. In my free time I like to play poker, do something on the piano, go for a swim, or distract friends by talking to them :).

		About This Website
	</h2>
	<p>
		Under <a href="classes.html">Classes</a>, I briefly highlight courses I've taken. On the <a href="work.html"> Work</a> page I share bits of  interesting "work" things I've done. The <a href="extras.html"> Extras</a> page includes fun things I used to do back in the day&mdash;highschool&mdash;along with more current endeavors. Finally, the <a href="thoughts.html"> Thoughts</a> page will be where I post random updates and celebrate (or complain about) the small things in life that I won't remember in a few years.
