					<h2> Comments </h2> 
					<p>Some words are definitely needed for this semester. 6.437 was by far the most enjoyable class
						though it consumed most of my time. The final project and amazing course content just made the course that much
					more enjoyable (thanks to Jiahai for often saving me before deadlines!) I must say I've fianlly experienced the MIT "firehose" education. </p>

					<h2> Comments </h2> 
					<p> My externship via 6.920 was quite demanding but I had a great time with my partner Yiming. In Battlecode, I was largely carried by my friend Michael, and I also got to know Matthew and Ashhad a lot better. I took 15.393 since my dad was taking it for fun, and he would bring me good non-MIT food (is that a redudancy?) every evening of the class&mdash;thanks Dad!</p>

					<h2> Comments </h2> 
					<p> Algebra I was my favorite class thanks to the amazing people I met (Daniel, CJ, Freddie) during lecture! 6.036 had fun homework assignments, 6.006 proved surprisingly challenging. 15.000 had the best dinners with the best speakers, and 8.0A6 was a fun seminar&mdash;Matt is an amazing advisor!</p>
