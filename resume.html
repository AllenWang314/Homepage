		Welcome recruiter! This is my not-so-secret resume page that I added to my personal website. If you've made it this far, I thank you for your time and patience. But before you get to the resume, please allow me to introduce myself!
		<br/>
		<br/>
		I'm Allen, a student at MIT, and this upcoming fall, I'm looking for a company to call home for my gap semester. I've worked before at Google, Elphi (a fintech startup), 
		and Learn Ventures (an online education startup). I've grown a bit... whats the word? ... enervated by the thought that my full potential wasn't really used. Maybe
		it was because I got too used to the startup life: I wanted to make a high impact, for both the company in the industry and myself in the company.
		I enjoyed wearing many hats: working on APIs, frontend stuff, data analytics, market research, or even ordering furniture for the office! I'm on track to graduate
		in 2022 after 2.5 years of formal schooling with a double major in computer science and mathematics as I am taking a gap semester this fall. At graduation, I hope to have
		found a startup that I will decide myself to for the next n years. If things don't work out, I'll be staying a 4th year to figure out my life as I
		earn my masters degree.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Anyways, that's my spiel for why I'm here, so let's get to the reason why you're here! Below, you can find an image preview of my resume. Clicking on it will lead to a download of the pdf.

		<br/>
		Wishing you safety, sanitation, and sanity,
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Allen Wang
